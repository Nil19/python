#Step 1: define a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that takes pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input. 
#Within the function body, include a pass statement to temporarily fill the function body.
def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    pass

#Step 2: Inside the function, replace the pass statement by creating an empty list named snake_cased_char_list.
    snake_cased_char_list = []

#Step 3: Inside the function, below the list you just created, add a for loop to iterate through the pascal_or_camel_cased_string. 
#Make sure to name the target variable char. For now, add a pass statement as a placeholder in the loop body.
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:

        pass
