#Step 1: Create a function named square_root_bisection
def square_root_bisection():
    pass

#Step 2: square_root_bisection function the following parameters
def square_root_bisection(square_target, tolerance = 1e-7, max_iterations = 100):
    pass

#Step 3: Remove the pass statement and create an if statement to check if square_target is less than 0.
    if square_target < 0:
        print(error)

#Step 4: If the square_target is less than 0, no real-valued square root can be computed. 
#Therefore, raise a ValueError with the message 'Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers'
        raise ValueError('Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers')

#Step 5: Create an if statement to check if square_target is equal to 1.
    if square_target < 0:
        raise ValueError('Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers');
    if square_target == 1:
        pass

#Step 6: If the square_target is equal to 1, declare a variable root and assign it the value 1 . Also, print the message 'The square root of {square_target} is 1'
    if square_target == 1:
        root = 1
        print(f'The square root of {square_target} is 1')

#Step 7: Create an elif statement to check if square_target is equal to 0. 
# If it is, assign the value 0 to the root variable. Also, print the message 'The square root of {square_target} is 0'
    elif square_target == 0:
        root = 0 
        print(f'The square root of {square_target} is 0')

#Step 8: Create an else clause
    else:
        pass

#Step 9:Inside the else clause, initialize the low variable to 0 and the high variable to be the maximum of either 1 or square_target as the 
# square root of a number is always less than or equal to the number itself.
    else:
        low = 0
        high = max(1, square_target)

# Step 10: Set the value of root to None as at this point, you don't have an approximate value yet.
        root = None

#Step 11: inside the else block, create a for loop that runs up to max_iterations times.
        for _ in range(max_iterations):
            pass

#Step 12: Inside the for loop, calculate the midpoint of the interval ranging from low to high. Assign this value to a variable mid.
# Also, calculate the square of the midpoint (mid) and store it in the variable square_mid.
        for _ in range(max_iterations):
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            square_mid = mid**2
        
#Step 13: create an if statement to check if the absolute value of the difference between square_mid and square_target is within the specified tolerance.
            if abs(square_mid - square_target) < tolerance:
                pass

#Step 14: If the difference is within the specified tolerance, set the value of root to mid and break out of the loop.
            if abs(square_mid - square_target) < tolerance:
                root = mid   
                break

#Step 15: If the difference is not within the specified tolerance, create an elif statement to check if square_mid is less than square_target.
#Assign the value of mid to low 
            elif (square_mid < square_target): 
                low = mid

#Step 16: If both the if and elif conditions are not met, the value of mid would be greater than square_target. 
# In this case, create an else clause and assign the value of mid to high.
            else:
                high = mid

#Step 17: Outside the for loop, create an if statement to check if root is None. If it is, print the message 'Failed to converge within {max_iterations} iterations.'
        if root is None:
            print(f'Failed to converge within {max_iterations} iterations.')

#Step 18: Create an else clause to handle the case where the value of root is not None, indicating that a root hass been found. 
#If it is not None, print the message 'The square root of {square_target} is approximately {root}'.
        else: 
            print(f'The square root of {square_target} is approximately {root}')

#Step 19: Finally, return the value of root from the square_root_bisection function.
        return root

#Step 20: Outside the function definiton, create a variable N and assign the value of 16 to it.
N = 16

#Step 21: Call the square_root_bisection function with the N variable as the argument. This will print the result to the console.
N = 16
square_root_bisection(N)
